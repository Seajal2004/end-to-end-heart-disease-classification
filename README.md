# end-to-end-heart-disease-classification
This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
We're going to take the following approach:
* Problem definition
* Data
* Evaluation
* Features
* Modelling
* Experimentation
